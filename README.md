Download the .exe from Releases and save it where you want the software to be ran from. Once launched for the first time, the software will go though a setup where you can choose the location of the remote as well as color scheme.

All setting files will be found in your documents folder under LMSoftware. A pallets.ini file is what stores your color pallets and then a folder for VMRemote which stores your settings.ini file.

When launching the software after the first time, the remote will pop up where you specified and a system tray icon will be made. If you want to change anything about the remote, go to the tray icon and right click and open settings. 

From the settings window you will be able to change which inputs or outputs you want to ignore and not have shown as well as set which voicemeeter version you are running. You will also be able to create or change your current color pallet.
